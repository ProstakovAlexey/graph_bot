Graph bot
=========
You can use the bot to organize the knowledge base.
For it need:
    1. Develop a solution graph for the problem and describe it in dot.
    2. Place dot file in path `graph`.
    3. Add section in `config.ini`.
    4. Run (restart) bot.

Now you can use program `graph_check.py` for check bot. I made a demonstration project - fishing,
you can see it in `graph`. Demo project deploying in Heroku, URL=http://polar-coast-24118.herokuapp.com/bot
Please look more documentation in `doc/`

If it is interesting for you - please help me. Now need javascript for site: small box for bot dialog.
